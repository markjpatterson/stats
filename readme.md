## Question 2

### QUESTION 2 (TOTAL MARKS: 25)

**Q2. (a)** (5 Marks)

Given n1 = 110, x1=65 and n2=120, x2=70, calculate a 90% confidence interval for the difference in the two proportions. Using the confidence interval, comment on the population proportions.

#### Answer Q2.(a)

##### Given Data
    - Sample 1:  
    - \( n_1 = 110 \)  
    - \( x_1 = 65 \)  

- Sample 2:  
  - \( n_2 = 120 \)  
  - \( x_2 = 70 \)  

##### Step 1: Calculate the Sample Proportions

- Sample proportion for group 1:  
  \( \hat{p}_1 = \frac{x_1}{n_1} = \frac{65}{110} \approx 0.5909 \)

- Sample proportion for group 2:  
  \( \hat{p}_2 = \frac{x_2}{n_2} = \frac{70}{120} \approx 0.5833 \)

##### Step 2: Calculate the Standard Error (SE)

- The formula for the standard error of the difference between two proportions is:  
  \[
  SE = \sqrt{\left(\frac{\hat{p}_1(1-\hat{p}_1)}{n_1}\right) + \left(\frac{\hat{p}_2(1-\hat{p}_2)}{n_2}\right)}
  \]

- Substituting the values:  
  \[
  SE = \sqrt{\left(\frac{0.5909(1-0.5909)}{110}\right) + \left(\frac{0.5833(1-0.5833)}{120}\right)} 
  \]
  \[
  SE \approx \sqrt{\left(\frac{0.2417}{110}\right) + \left(\frac{0.2431}{120}\right)} 
  \]
  \[
  SE \approx \sqrt{0.002197 + 0.002026} 
  \]
  \[
  SE \approx \sqrt{0.004223} 
  \]
  \[
  SE \approx 0.0650 
  \]

##### Step 3: Determine the Critical Value

- For a 90% confidence level, the critical value \( z^* \) is approximately 1.645.

##### Step 4: Calculate the Confidence Interval

- The confidence interval for the difference in proportions \( (\hat{p}_1 - \hat{p}_2) \) is given by:  
  \[
  (\hat{p}_1 - \hat{p}_2) \pm z^* \times SE
  \]

- Substituting the values:  
  \[
  (0.5909 - 0.5833) \pm 1.645 \times 0.0650
  \]
  \[
  0.0076 \pm 0.1069
  \]

- The confidence interval is:  
  \[
  -0.0993 \text{ to } 0.1145
  \]

##### Step 5: Interpretation of the Confidence Interval

- The 90% confidence interval for the difference in population proportions ranges from \(-0.0993\) to \(0.1145\).
- Since this interval includes zero, we **cannot** conclude that there is a significant difference between the two population proportions at the 90% confidence level.

###### Q2. (b)

Calculate and interpret the \(R^2\) value from the following sample data:
X = {7,19,33,42}; Y = {6, 10, 14,23}.

#### Answer Q2.(b)

### Calculation of \( R^2 \) (Coefficient of Determination)

Given:
 \( X = \{7, 19, 33, 42\} \)
 \( Y = \{6, 10, 14, 23\} \)

The coefficient of determination \( R^2 \) measures the proportion of the variance in the dependent variable \( Y \) that is predictable from the independent variable \( X \).

To calculate \( R^2 \), we need to:
1. Find the regression line \( Y = a + bX \).
2. Calculate the predicted values \( \hat{Y} \).
3. Calculate the Total Sum of Squares (SST).
4. Calculate the Regression Sum of Squares (SSR).
5. Finally, calculate \( R^2 \).

Let's go through the steps.

#### 1. Calculate the regression coefficients \( a \) and \( b \)

The formulas for the slope \( b \) and intercept \( a \) are:

\[
b = \frac{n\sum(XY) - \sum X \sum Y}{n\sum X^2 - (\sum X)^2}
\]

\[
a = \frac{\sum Y - b\sum X}{n}
\]

#### 2. Calculate the predicted values \( \hat{Y} \)
\[
\hat{Y_i} = a + bX_i
\]

#### 3. Calculate SST (Total Sum of Squares)
\[
SST = \sum (Y_i - \bar{Y})^2
\]
where \( \bar{Y} \) is the mean of \( Y \).

#### 4. Calculate SSR (Regression Sum of Squares)
\[
SSR = \sum (\hat{Y_i} - \bar{Y})^2
\]

#### 5. Calculate \( R^2 \)
\[
R^2 = \frac{SSR}{SST}
\]

Now, let's perform these calculations. I'll do this step-by-step.

### Results

1. **Regression Equation**: 
   \[
   \hat{Y} = 1.852 + 0.451X
   \]
   
2. **Predicted Values \( \hat{Y} \)**:
   \[
   \hat{Y} = \{5.01, 10.43, 16.75, 20.81\}
   \]

3. **Total Sum of Squares (SST)**: 
   \[
   SST = 158.75
   \]

4. **Regression Sum of Squares (SSR)**:
   \[
   SSR = 145.24
   \]

5. **\( R^2 \) Value**: 
   \[
   R^2 = 0.915
   \]

#### Interpretation

The \( R^2 \) value of approximately **0.915** indicates that about **91.5%** of the variability in the dependent variable \( Y \) is explained by the independent variable \( X \) in the regression model. This suggests a strong relationship between \( X \) and \( Y \) in this dataset.

**Q2. (c)**

Given E[X]=0.88, E[X2]=1.12, E[Y]=0.92,E[Y2]=1.14,E[XY]= 0.55, calculate the

### Problem Type
This is a **statistics** problem, specifically dealing with **correlation** between two random variables. The problem gives you the means, variances, and covariance between the random variables \( X \) and \( Y \). Your task is to calculate the correlation coefficient between \( X \) and \( Y \).

### Information Given
You are given the following statistical parameters:

- \( E[X] = 0.88 \): The expected value (mean) of \( X \).
- \( E[X^2] = 1.12 \): The expected value of \( X^2 \).
- \( E[Y] = 0.92 \): The expected value (mean) of \( Y \).
- \( E[Y^2] = 1.14 \): The expected value of \( Y^2 \).
- \( E[XY] = 0.55 \): The expected value of the product \( XY \).

### Step-by-Step Solution

1. **Calculate the Variance of \( X \) and \( Y \):**

   The variance of a random variable \( Z \) is given by:
   \[
   \text{Var}(Z) = E[Z^2] - (E[Z])^2
   \]
   - For \( X \):
     \[
     \text{Var}(X) = E[X^2] - (E[X])^2 = 1.12 - (0.88)^2
     \]
   - For \( Y \):
     \[
     \text{Var}(Y) = E[Y^2] - (E[Y])^2 = 1.14 - (0.92)^2
     \]

2. **Calculate the Covariance of \( X \) and \( Y \):**

   The covariance of \( X \) and \( Y \) is given by:
   \[
   \text{Cov}(X, Y) = E[XY] - E[X]E[Y]
   \]
   Substituting the given values:
   \[
   \text{Cov}(X, Y) = 0.55 - (0.88)(0.92)
   \]

3. **Calculate the Correlation Coefficient \( \rho_{XY} \):**

   The correlation coefficient is given by:
   \[
   \rho_{XY} = \frac{\text{Cov}(X, Y)}{\sqrt{\text{Var}(X)} \cdot \sqrt{\text{Var}(Y)}}
   \]

   Using the values of \( \text{Cov}(X, Y) \), \( \text{Var}(X) \), and \( \text{Var}(Y) \) calculated above, you can compute the correlation coefficient.

### Detailed Computation

Let's go through the detailed calculations.

1. **Variance of \( X \):**
   \[
   \text{Var}(X) = 1.12 - (0.88)^2 = 1.12 - 0.7744 = 0.3456
   \]

2. **Variance of \( Y \):**
   \[
   \text{Var}(Y) = 1.14 - (0.92)^2 = 1.14 - 0.8464 = 0.2936
   \]

3. **Covariance of \( X \) and \( Y \):**
   \[
   \text{Cov}(X, Y) = 0.55 - (0.88 \times 0.92) = 0.55 - 0.8096 = -0.2596
   \]

4. **Correlation Coefficient \( \rho_{XY} \):**
   \[
   \rho_{XY} = \frac{-0.2596}{\sqrt{0.3456} \cdot \sqrt{0.2936}} = \frac{-0.2596}{\sqrt{0.3456 \times 0.2936}} = \frac{-0.2596}{\sqrt{0.10142656}} = \frac{-0.2596}{0.3185} \approx -0.8153
   \]

### Final Answer
The correlation coefficient between \( X \) and \( Y \) is approximately \( \rho_{XY} \approx -0.8153 \).

This tells us that \( X \) and \( Y \) have a strong negative linear relationship correlation between X and Y.

**Q2. (d)**

A race track is open to the public for both motorcycle and car use. The lap times (minutes) of
motorcycles is XM ~ N(u=3.4,o=1.4). The lap times of cars is Xc ~ N(p=3.6,o=0.78).

(i) Calculate the probability that the average lap time is between 3 and 4 minutes for a group of ten motorcyclists.

### Problem Type
This is a **probability** and **statistics** problem, specifically dealing with the **normal distribution** and the **sampling distribution of the sample mean**. You are asked to calculate the probability that the average lap time for a group of ten motorcyclists falls within a specific range.

### Information Given
You are provided with the following information about the lap times of motorcycles:

- The lap times for individual motorcycles are normally distributed: \( X_M \sim \mathcal{N}(\mu = 3.4, \sigma = 1.4) \).
- You want to calculate the probability that the average lap time for a group of 10 motorcyclists (\( \bar{X}_M \)) is between 3 and 4 minutes.

### Step-by-Step Solution

1. **Sampling Distribution of the Sample Mean:**

   The sample mean \( \bar{X}_M \) for a group of \( n = 10 \) motorcyclists is also normally distributed:
   
    \[
   \bar{X} \sim \mathcal{N}\left(\mu = \mu, \sigma = \frac{\sigma}{\sqrt{n}}\right)
   \]
   
   \[
   \bar{X}_M \sim \mathcal{N}\left(\mu_{\bar{X}_M} = \mu, \sigma_{\bar{X}_M} = \frac{\sigma}{\sqrt{n}}\right)
   \]
   - Mean of the sample mean \( \mu_{\bar{X}_M} = 3.4 \).
   - Standard deviation of the sample mean (Standard Error): 
     \[
     \sigma_{\bar{X}_M} = \frac{1.4}{\sqrt{10}} \approx \frac{1.4}{3.162} \approx 0.4426
     \]

2. **Standardizing the Variable:**

   To find the probability that the average lap time is between 3 and 4 minutes, we first convert these values to their corresponding standard normal \( z \)-scores using the formula:
   \[
   z = \frac{\bar{X}_M - \mu_{\bar{X}_M}}{\sigma_{\bar{X}_M}}
   \]
   - For \( \bar{X}_M = 3 \):
     \[
     z_1 = \frac{3 - 3.4}{0.4426} \approx \frac{-0.4}{0.4426} \approx -0.904
     \]
   - For \( \bar{X}_M = 4 \):
     \[
     z_2 = \frac{4 - 3.4}{0.4426} \approx \frac{0.6}{0.4426} \approx 1.356
     \]

3. **Finding the Probability:**

   The probability that the average lap time is between 3 and 4 minutes is the area under the standard normal curve between \( z_1 \) and \( z_2 \).

   - You can find these probabilities using the standard normal distribution table or a calculator.
     \[
     P(z_1 < Z < z_2) = P(-0.904 < Z < 1.356)
     \]
   - From the standard normal distribution table:
     - \( P(Z < -0.904) \approx 0.1831 \)
     - \( P(Z < 1.356) \approx 0.9125 \)
     - So:
       \[
       P(-0.904 < Z < 1.356) = P(Z < 1.356) - P(Z < -0.904) = 0.9125 - 0.1831 = 0.7294
       \]

### Final Answer
The probability that the average lap time for a group of ten motorcyclists is between 3 and 4 minutes is approximately **0.7294**.

### Summary
This problem involves calculating the probability that a sample mean falls within a given range, using properties of the normal distribution and the standardization process.


(ii) Calculate the probability that a motorcycle is faster than a car.

### Problem Type
This is a **probability** problem involving the **normal distribution**. You are asked to calculate the probability that a randomly selected motorcycle is faster (i.e., has a shorter lap time) than a randomly selected car.

### Information Given
You are provided with the following information about the lap times:

- **Motorcycles:** \( X_M \sim \mathcal{N}(3.4, 1.4^2) \)
- **Cars:** \( X_C \sim \mathcal{N}(3.6, 0.78^2) \)

We need to calculate \( P(X_M < X_C) \), the probability that a motorcycle is faster than a car.

### Step-by-Step Solution

1. **Difference in Lap Times:**

   Define a new random variable \( D \) as the difference in lap times between a car and a motorcycle:
   \[
   D = X_C - X_M
   \]
   \( D \) represents the time difference, where a positive \( D \) indicates that the car is slower, and a negative \( D \) indicates that the motorcycle is slower. We want to calculate \( P(D > 0) \), which is the probability that the motorcycle is faster.

2. **Distribution of \( D \):**

   Since \( X_M \) and \( X_C \) are normally distributed, the difference \( D \) is also normally distributed:
   \[
   D \sim \mathcal{N}(\mu_D, \sigma_D^2)
   \]
   - The mean of \( D \):
     \[
     \mu_D = \mu_C - \mu_M = 3.6 - 3.4 = 0.2
     \]
   - The variance of \( D \) (since \( X_M \) and \( X_C \) are independent):
     \[
     \sigma_D^2 = \sigma_C^2 + \sigma_M^2 = 0.78^2 + 1.4^2 = 0.6084 + 1.96 = 2.5684
     \]
   - The standard deviation of \( D \):
     \[
     \sigma_D = \sqrt{2.5684} \approx 1.6026
     \]
   Therefore:
   \[
   D \sim \mathcal{N}(0.2, 1.6026^2)
   \]

3. **Standardizing the Variable:**

   To find \( P(D > 0) \), standardize \( D \) to the standard normal distribution \( Z \):
   \[
   Z = \frac{D - \mu_D}{\sigma_D}
   \]
   For \( D = 0 \):
   \[
   Z = \frac{0 - 0.2}{1.6026} \approx \frac{-0.2}{1.6026} \approx -0.1248
   \]

4. **Finding the Probability:**

   The probability \( P(D > 0) \) is the same as \( P(Z > -0.1248) \).
   
   - From the standard normal distribution table, find \( P(Z > -0.1248) \).
   - \( P(Z > -0.1248) \) is equal to \( 1 - P(Z < -0.1248) \).
   - From the standard normal table:
     \[
     P(Z < -0.1248) \approx 0.4503
     \]
   - Therefore:
     \[
     P(Z > -0.1248) = 1 - 0.4503 = 0.5497
     \]

### Final Answer
The probability that a randomly selected motorcycle is faster than a randomly selected car is approximately **0.5497**.

### Summary
This problem involves finding the probability that the lap time of one normally distributed random variable is less than that of another. By calculating the distribution of the difference and then standardizing, we can determine this probability.

## Question 3

**Q3. (a)**
Briefly describe the terms ANOVA and family-wise error rate in the context of ANOVA.
(4 Marks)

### ANOVA (Analysis of Variance)
ANOVA, or Analysis of Variance, is a statistical method used to compare the means of three or more groups to determine if there are any statistically significant differences between them. It does this by analyzing the variance within each group and the variance between the groups.

### Family-Wise Error Rate in ANOVA
The family-wise error rate is the probability of making one or more Type I errors when performing multiple comparisons in ANOVA.

\( X \sim \text{Exp}(\lambda) \) with \( E[X] = \frac{1}{\lambda} \) and \( \text{Var}[X] = \frac{1}{\lambda^2} \).

(i) State the \(sigma_{\bar{X}}\) value.
(3 Marks)

### Problem Type
This is a **probability and statistics** problem, specifically dealing with the **exponential distribution**. The problem requires calculating the standard deviation (\(\sigma_X\)) of a random variable that follows an exponential distribution.

### How to Solve It

1. **Identify the Given Information:**
   - The random variable \(X\) follows an exponential distribution: \(X \sim \text{Exp}(\lambda)\).
   - The mean \(E[X]\) and variance \(\text{Var}[X]\) of \(X\) are provided:
     \[
     E[X] = \frac{1}{\lambda}
     \]
     \[
     \text{Var}[X] = \frac{1}{\lambda^2}
     \]

2. **Recall the Relationship Between Variance and Standard Deviation:**
   - The standard deviation \(\sigma_X\) is the square root of the variance:
     \[
     \sigma_X = \sqrt{\text{Var}[X]}
     \]

3. **Calculate the Standard Deviation:**
   - Substitute the variance into the formula for standard deviation:
     \[
     \text{Var}[X] = \frac{1}{\lambda^2}
     \]
     \[
     \sigma_X = \sqrt{\frac{1}{\lambda^2}} = \frac{1}{\lambda}
     \]


This solution involves understanding the properties of the exponential distribution and applying the relationship between variance and standard deviation.

For \( X \sim \text{Exp}(\lambda) \) with \( E[X] = \frac{1}{\lambda} \) and \( \text{Var}[X] = \frac{1}{\lambda^2} \), the standard deviation \( \sigma_X \) is:

\[
\sigma_X = \frac{1}{\lambda}
\]

(ii) Explain how the value from part (i) above was obtained.

### Summary

The value of \( \sigma_X \) was obtained by recognizing that the standard deviation is the square root of the variance. Given that the variance of the exponential distribution is \( \frac{1}{\lambda^2} \), taking the square root yields the standard deviation:

\[
\sigma_X = \frac{1}{\lambda}
\]

### Q3. (c)

Let \( p \) be the fraction of engineers who do not understand basic statistical concepts. In the past, this has been high; \( p = 0.73 \). A new program has been implemented to improve the engineers' knowledge, and it is expected that \( p \) would decrease from 0.73. 

To test the hypotheses:
- \( H_0: p \geq 0.73 \)
- \( H_1: p < 0.73 \)

300 engineers in the new program were tested, and 208 did not comprehend basic statistical concepts. At the 5% significance level, can \( H_0 \) be rejected in favor of \( H_1 \)?
(5 Marks)

### Problem Type
This is a **hypothesis testing** problem involving a **proportion**. Specifically, it is a **one-sample test for a proportion** where the objective is to determine if there is sufficient evidence to reject the null hypothesis in favor of the alternative hypothesis based on sample data.

### Step-by-Step Solution

1. **State the Hypotheses:**
   - **Null Hypothesis (H₀):** \( p \geq 0.73 \) (the proportion of engineers who do not understand basic statistical concepts is at least 0.73)
   - **Alternative Hypothesis (H₁):** \( p < 0.73 \) (the proportion of engineers who do not understand basic statistical concepts is less than 0.73)

2. **Set the Significance Level:**
   - The significance level (\(\alpha\)) is given as 5%, or 0.05.

3. **Collect and Summarize the Data:**
   - Sample size (\(n\)) = 300
   - Number of engineers who do not comprehend basic statistical concepts (\(x\)) = 208
   - Sample proportion (\(\hat{p}\)) = \(\frac{x}{n} = \frac{208}{300} \approx 0.6933\)

4. **Perform the Test:**
   - **Calculate the Test Statistic:**
     The test statistic for a proportion is calculated using the formula:
     \[
     z = \frac{\hat{p} - p_0}{\sqrt{\frac{p_0(1 - p_0)}{n}}}
     \]
     where \( p_0 \) is the hypothesized proportion (0.73), \(\hat{p}\) is the sample proportion, and \( n \) is the sample size.

     Plugging in the values:
     \[
     z = \frac{0.6933 - 0.73}{\sqrt{\frac{0.73 \times (1 - 0.73)}{300}}}
     \]
     \[
     z = \frac{-0.0367}{\sqrt{\frac{0.73 \times 0.27}{300}}}
     \]
     \[
     z = \frac{-0.0367}{\sqrt{0.000657}} \approx \frac{-0.0367}{0.0256} \approx -1.43
     \]

   - **Determine the Critical Value:**
     For a one-tailed test at the 5% significance level, the critical value from the standard normal distribution (Z-table) is approximately -1.645.

5. **Compare the Test Statistic to the Critical Value:**
   - The calculated \( z \)-value is -1.43.
   - The critical value for \(\alpha = 0.05\) is -1.645.

   Since -1.43 is greater than -1.645, we fail to reject the null hypothesis.

6. **Draw a Conclusion:**
   - Since the test statistic does not fall in the rejection region, there is not enough evidence to reject the null hypothesis at the 5% significance level. Therefore, we do not have sufficient evidence to support that the proportion of engineers who do not understand basic statistical concepts has decreased from 0.73.

### Summary

At the 5% significance level, the null hypothesis \( H_0: p \geq 0.73 \) cannot be rejected in favor of \( H_1: p < 0.73 \) based on the sample data provided.


### Problem Statement

The attendance (hundreds) at a racetrack (\(x\)), and the amount (€ \times 10^6) that was gambled (\(y\)), on \(n = 10\) selected days are given in the following table:

| Attendance | 117  | 128  | 122  | 119  | 131  | 135  | 125  | 120  | 130  | 127  |
|------------|------|------|------|------|------|------|------|------|------|------|
| Amount Bet  | 2.07 | 2.80 | 3.14 | 2.26 | 3.40 | 3.89 | 2.93 | 2.66 | 3.33 | 3.54 |

Given the following statistics:
- \(\sum x_i = 1254\)
- \(\sum y_i = 30.02\)
- \(\sum x_i^2 = 157558\)
- \(\sum y_i^2 = 93.0652\)
- \(\sum x_i y_i = 3791.09\)
- \(\sum x_i^2 y_i = 1505902\)

(i) Calculate the sample correlation coefficient.

### Calculating the Sample Correlation Coefficient

The sample correlation coefficient \( r \) between two variables \( x \) and \( y \) is given by:

\[
r = \frac{n \sum x_i y_i - (\sum x_i)(\sum y_i)}{\sqrt{\left[n \sum x_i^2 - (\sum x_i)^2\right] \left[n \sum y_i^2 - (\sum y_i)^2\right]}}
\]

Where:
- \( n \) = number of data points
- \( \sum x_i \) = sum of \( x \) values
- \( \sum y_i \) = sum of \( y \) values
- \( \sum x_i^2 \) = sum of squares of \( x \) values
- \( \sum y_i^2 \) = sum of squares of \( y \) values
- \( \sum x_i y_i \) = sum of the product of \( x \) and \( y \) values

### Given Data

From the provided data:
- \( n = 10 \)
- \( \sum x_i = 1254 \)
- \( \sum y_i = 30.02 \)
- \( \sum x_i^2 = 157558 \)
- \( \sum y_i^2 = 93.0652 \)
- \( \sum x_i y_i = 3791.09 \)

### Calculation

1. **Calculate the numerator:**

\[
n \sum x_i y_i - (\sum x_i)(\sum y_i)
\]

\[
= 10 \times 3791.09 - (1254 \times 30.02)
\]

\[
= 37910.9 - 37675.08
\]

\[
= 235.82
\]

2. **Calculate the denominator:**

   - First term: \( n \sum x_i^2 - (\sum x_i)^2 \)
   
   \[
   = 10 \times 157558 - (1254)^2
   \]

   \[
   = 1575580 - 1575076
   \]

   \[
   = 504
   \]

   - Second term: \( n \sum y_i^2 - (\sum y_i)^2 \)
   
   \[
   = 10 \times 93.0652 - (30.02)^2
   \]

   \[
   = 930.652 - 900.4004
   \]

   \[
   = 30.2516

(ii) Determine the linear regression equation.

### To determine the linear regression equation of the form:

\[
y = a + bx
\]

Where:
- \( y \) is the dependent variable (amount gambled),
- \( x \) is the independent variable (attendance),
- \( a \) is the y-intercept,
- \( b \) is the slope.

### Step 1: Calculate the Slope (\( b \))

The slope \( b \) is calculated using the formula:

\[
b = \frac{n \sum x_i y_i - (\sum x_i)(\sum y_i)}{n \sum x_i^2 - (\sum x_i)^2}
\]

Substitute the given values:

\[
b = \frac{10 \times 3791.09 - (1254 \times 30.02)}{10 \times 157558 - (1254)^2}
\]

Calculate the numerator:

\[
10 \times 3791.09 = 37910.9
\]

\[
1254 \times 30.02 = 37675.08
\]

\[
\text{Numerator} = 37910.9 - 37675.08 = 235.82
\]

Calculate the denominator:

\[
10 \times 157558 = 1575580
\]

\[
(1254)^2 = 1575076
\]

\[
\text{Denominator} = 1575580 - 1575076 = 504
\]

Now, calculate the slope \( b \):

\[
b = \frac{235.82}{504} \approx 0.4678
\]

### Step 2: Calculate the Y-intercept (\( a \))

The y-intercept \( a \) is calculated using the formula:

\[
a = \frac{\sum y_i - b \sum x_i}{n}
\]

Substitute the known values:

\[
a = \frac{30.02 - 0.4678 \times 1254}{10}
\]

Calculate the expression:

\[
0.4678 \times 1254 \approx 586.7352
\]

\[
30.02 - 586.7352 \approx -556.7152
\]

\[
a = \frac{-556.7152}{10} \approx -55.6715
\]

### Step 3: Write the Linear Regression Equation

The linear regression equation is:

\[
y = -55.6715 + 0.4678x
\]

### Final Answer

The linear regression equation based on the given data is:

\[
y = -55.6715 + 0.4678x
\]


(iii) Provide an interpretation of the equation obtained in part (ii) above.

The linear regression equation obtained is:

\[
y = -55.6715 + 0.4678x
\]

### Interpretation:

- **Slope (\( b = 0.4678 \))**: The slope indicates that for every increase of 100 people in attendance at the racetrack, the amount gambled increases by approximately €0.4678 million. This positive relationship suggests that higher attendance generally leads to higher amounts of money being gambled.

- **Y-intercept (\( a = -55.6715 \))**: The y-intercept represents the predicted amount gambled when the attendance is zero. However, in this context, a negative y-intercept does not have a practical interpretation because it suggests a negative amount gambled, which is not possible. This negative value could indicate that the linear model is not suitable for very low attendance values or that the relationship between attendance and the amount gambled is not perfectly linear at the extremes.

### Summary:

The equation suggests a positive linear relationship between attendance at the racetrack and the amount of money gambled. As attendance increases, the amount gambled also increases, but the negative y-intercept implies that the model may not be accurate for small attendance numbers.


## QUESTION 4 (TOTAL MARKS: 25)
**Q4. (a)**
In the context of regression analysis, briefly explain the meaning of the terms: SSE, SSR, SST.
(3 Marks)

In the context of regression analysis, the terms SSE, SSR, and SST are used to measure different components of the variability in the data:

1. **SSE (Sum of Squared Errors)**:
   - **Definition**: SSE measures the total deviation of the observed values from the predicted values (the regression line). It represents the unexplained variation or the error in the model.
   - **Formula**: 
     \[
     \text{SSE} = \sum_{i=1}^{n} (y_i - \hat{y}_i)^2
     \]
     where \( y_i \) are the observed values, and \( \hat{y}_i \) are the predicted values from the regression line.

2. **SSR (Sum of Squares due to Regression)**:
   - **Definition**: SSR measures the total deviation of the predicted values from the mean of the observed values. It represents the explained variation by the regression model.
   - **Formula**: 
     \[
     \text{SSR} = \sum_{i=1}^{n} (\hat{y}_i - \bar{y})^2
     \]
     where \( \hat{y}_i \) are the predicted values, and \( \bar{y} \) is the mean of the observed values.

3. **SST (Total Sum of Squares)**:
   - **Definition**: SST measures the total deviation of the observed values from their mean. It represents the total variation in the observed data.
   - **Formula**: 
     \[
     \text{SST} = \sum_{i=1}^{n} (y_i - \bar{y})^2
     \]
     where \( y_i \) are the observed values, and \( \bar{y} \) is the mean of the observed values.

### Relationship:
- The relationship between these terms is expressed as:
  \[
  \text{SST} = \text{SSR} + \text{SSE}
  \]
- This equation shows that the total variation in the data (SST) is the sum of the variation explained by the regression model (SSR) and the unexplained variation or error (SSE).


**Q4. (b)**
In a two-tailed hypothesis test with a significance level of 5%, a researcher obtains a test statistic value of ( z = -2.2 ). Determine the p-value, and explain what this value means in relation to ( H_0 ).
(4 Marks)

### Type of Question
This question is a **hypothesis testing** problem, specifically involving a **two-tailed z-test**. The goal is to determine the p-value associated with the test statistic and interpret its significance in relation to the null hypothesis (\(H_0\)).

### Steps to Answer the Question

1. **Identify the Given Information**:
   - **Test statistic**: \( z = -2.2 \)
   - **Significance level**: \( \alpha = 0.05 \) (for a two-tailed test)

2. **Determine the p-value**:
   - The p-value is the probability of obtaining a test statistic as extreme as, or more extreme than, the observed value under the null hypothesis.
   - Since this is a two-tailed test, the p-value is calculated by finding the area in both tails of the standard normal distribution corresponding to \( z = -2.2 \) and \( z = 2.2 \).
   - First, find the area to the left of \( z = -2.2 \) using a z-table or statistical software.
     - Look up \( z = -2.2 \) in the z-table (or use a calculator), which gives a cumulative probability of approximately 0.0139.
   - Since it is a two-tailed test, the p-value is:
     \[
     \text{p-value} = 2 \times P(Z < -2.2) = 2 \times 0.0139 = 0.0278
     \]

3. **Interpret the p-value**:
   - The p-value of approximately 0.0278 represents the probability of observing a test statistic as extreme as \( z = -2.2 \) (or \( z = 2.2 \)) under the null hypothesis \( H_0 \).
   - Compare the p-value to the significance level \( \alpha = 0.05 \):
     - Since the p-value (0.0278) is less than the significance level (0.05), you reject the null hypothesis \( H_0 \).
     - This means there is sufficient evidence to suggest that the test statistic is significantly different from zero, indicating that the observed effect is statistically significant.

### Final Answer:

- **p-value**: The p-value is approximately 0.0278.
- **Interpretation**: Since the p-value (0.0278) is less than the significance level (0.05), you reject the null hypothesis \( H_0 \). This suggests that the observed test statistic \( z = -2.2 \) provides enough evidence to conclude that there is a statistically significant effect, and the null hypothesis is unlikely to be true.


**Q4. (c)**
A scientist is interested in assessing the relationship between two variables ( V_1 ) (independent) and ( V_2 ) (dependent) and takes ( n = 10 ) sample values from a lab experiment. Given ( r \approx -0.96 ):

(i)Sketch a scatterplot to visualize the overall pattern of the lab results.
(2 Marks)


### Sketch a Scatterplot to Visualize the Overall Pattern

To visualize the relationship between the two variables \( V_1 \) (independent) and \( V_2 \) (dependent) given that \( r \approx -0.96 \), follow these steps:

#### Step 1: Understand the Correlation
- The correlation coefficient \( r = -0.96 \) indicates a strong negative linear relationship between \( V_1 \) and \( V_2 \).
- This means that as \( V_1 \) increases, \( V_2 \) tends to decrease, and the points will cluster closely around a line with a downward slope.

#### Step 2: Sketch the Scatterplot
1. **Draw the Axes**:
   - Draw two perpendicular lines to represent the axes. Label the horizontal axis as \( V_1 \) and the vertical axis as \( V_2 \).

2. **Plot Points**:
   - Since \( r \approx -0.96 \), plot the points so that they form a tight cluster around a line with a negative slope.
   - Although the points should be close to the line, small deviations from the line should be visible to show that the relationship is not perfectly linear.

3. **Draw the Line of Best Fit**:
   - Sketch a line that best fits the points. This line should have a negative slope, reflecting the strong negative correlation.

#### Visual Representation

Here’s a rough textual representation of the scatterplot:


V_2  |      *  
     |    *     
     |   *       
     |  *       
     | *        
     |*         
     |           
     |_________________
             V_1


- The asterisks (\(*\)) represent the data points.
- The points should align closely to a straight line sloping downward from left to right.

#### Summary
The scatterplot visualizes the strong negative relationship between \( V_1 \) and \( V_2 \). The data points are tightly clustered around a line with a negative slope, consistent with the correlation coefficient \( r \approx -0.96 \). To create an accurate scatterplot, you would typically use graphing software or plot the actual data points on graph paper.

(ii)Comment on the causal relationship between ( V_1 ) and ( V_2 ).
(3 Marks)

#### Comment on the Causal Relationship between \( V_1 \) and \( V_2 \)

While a strong correlation between two variables, such as \( V_1 \) and \( V_2 \), suggests a significant relationship, it does not imply causation. Here’s a breakdown of key considerations regarding the causal relationship:

#### Correlation vs. Causation
- **Correlation**: The correlation coefficient \( r \approx -0.96 \) indicates a strong negative linear relationship between \( V_1 \) and \( V_2 \). This means that as \( V_1 \) increases, \( V_2 \) tends to decrease, and vice versa.
- **Causation**: To establish a causal relationship, additional evidence is needed beyond correlation. Correlation alone cannot determine which variable influences the other, if at all.

#### Factors to Consider
1. **Direction of Causation**:
   - It’s not clear from the correlation alone whether \( V_1 \) causes changes in \( V_2 \), \( V_2 \) causes changes in \( V_1 \), or if there is another underlying factor influencing both variables.

2. **Confounding Variables**:
   - There may be other variables not accounted for that influence both \( V_1 \) and \( V_2 \). These confounding variables could create a misleading appearance of a direct relationship between \( V_1 \) and \( V_2 \).

3. **Experimental Evidence**:
   - To establish causation, controlled experiments or longitudinal studies are required. These studies help determine if changes in \( V_1 \) directly cause changes in \( V_2 \), and they often involve manipulating one variable while controlling others.

4. **Mechanism of Action**:
   - A clear mechanism explaining how \( V_1 \) could influence \( V_2 \) is needed to support a causal claim. This involves understanding the process or pathway through which one variable affects the other.

#### Summary
Although a strong negative correlation between \( V_1 \) and \( V_2 \) suggests a significant relationship, it does not establish causality. Further research, such as controlled experiments and investigations into potential confounding variables, is required to determine if \( V_1 \) causes changes in \( V_2 \) or if the observed relationship is due to other factors.


**Q4. (d)**
It is known that 5% of manufactured components are defective. Samples of size ( n = 800 ) are drawn from the process in order to determine the proportion of defects. Determine the proportion of samples that are likely to contain more than 6% defects.
Note: ( X \sim \text{Bin}(n, p) ), ( E[X] = np ), ( \text{Var}[X] = np(1-p) ), ( \hat{p} = X/n ).
(5 Marks)

### Type of Question

This is a **probability question** involving the **binomial distribution** and its approximation using the **normal distribution**. Specifically, you need to find the proportion of samples where the defect rate exceeds 6%, given that the true defect rate is 5%.

### Steps to Answer the Question

#### 1. Define the Binomial Distribution

Given:
- The defect rate (probability of defect) \( p = 0.05 \)
- Sample size \( n = 800 \)

Let \( X \) be the number of defective components in a sample of size \( n \). The random variable \( X \) follows a binomial distribution:

\[
X \sim \text{Bin}(n = 800, p = 0.05)
\]

The proportion of defective components is:

\[
\hat{p} = \frac{X}{n}
\]

#### 2. Calculate the Mean and Variance of the Binomial Distribution

- **Mean** (\( \mu \)) of \( X \):

\[
\mu = np = 800 \times 0.05 = 40
\]

- **Variance** (\( \sigma^2 \)) of \( X \):

\[
\sigma^2 = np(1-p) = 800 \times 0.05 \times (1 - 0.05) = 800 \times 0.05 \times 0.95 = 38
\]

- **Standard Deviation** (\( \sigma \)) of \( X \):

\[
\sigma = \sqrt{38} \approx 6.16
\]

#### 3. Use the Normal Approximation

For large sample sizes, the binomial distribution can be approximated by a normal distribution with mean \( \mu \) and standard deviation \( \sigma \).

- **Normal Distribution**:

\[
X \approx \text{N}(\mu = 40, \sigma^2 = 38)
\]

- To find the proportion of samples with more than 6% defects:

\[
\hat{p} > 0.06 \quad \text{implies} \quad \frac{X}{n} > 0.06 \quad \text{or} \quad X > 0.06 \times 800 = 48
\]

We need to find \( P(X > 48) \) using the normal approximation:

\[
P(X > 48) \approx P\left( Z > \frac{48 - 40}{\sigma} \right)
\]

Calculate the Z-score:

\[
Z = \frac{48 - 40}{6.16} \approx \frac{8}{6.16} \approx 1.30
\]

#### 4. Find the Proportion Using Z-Table

- Look up the Z-score \( 1.30 \) in the Z-table to find the cumulative probability.

\[
P(Z \leq 1.30) \approx 0.9032
\]

- To find \( P(Z > 1.30) \):

\[
P(Z > 1.30) = 1 - P(Z \leq 1.30) = 1 - 0.9032 = 0.0968
\]

### Summary

Approximately \( 9.68\% \) of the samples are likely to contain more than 6% defective components.


**Q4. (e)**
95% of ( \bar{X} ) values lie in the range ( \mu \pm 1.96 \frac{\sigma}{\sqrt{n}} ). Rewrite this statement in terms of a probability equation and rearrange the equation to obtain an interval estimate for ( \mu ).
(8 Marks)

### Type of Question

This is a **statistical inference** question involving **confidence intervals**. Specifically, it involves translating a verbal statement about a confidence interval into a probability equation and then rearranging that equation to express an interval estimate for the population mean \( \mu \).

### Answering the Question

#### 1. Translate the Statement into a Probability Equation

The statement "95% of \( \bar{X} \) values lie in the range \( \mu \pm 1.96 \frac{\sigma}{\sqrt{n}} \)" can be translated into a probability statement about the sample mean \( \bar{X} \) as follows:

\[
P\left(\mu - 1.96 \frac{\sigma}{\sqrt{n}} \leq \bar{X} \leq \mu + 1.96 \frac{\sigma}{\sqrt{n}}\right) = 0.95
\]

This equation reflects that there is a 95% probability that the sample mean \( \bar{X} \) will fall within the interval centered around \( \mu \) with a margin of error \( 1.96 \frac{\sigma}{\sqrt{n}} \).

#### 2. Rearrange to Obtain an Interval Estimate for \( \mu \)

To express \( \mu \) as an interval estimate based on the sample mean \( \bar{X} \), rearrange the probability statement. Start with the probability equation:

\[
P\left(\mu - 1.96 \frac{\sigma}{\sqrt{n}} \leq \bar{X} \leq \mu + 1.96 \frac{\sigma}{\sqrt{n}}\right) = 0.95
\]

To solve for \( \mu \), rearrange the inequality:

1. **Isolate \( \mu \)**:
   - The interval estimate for \( \mu \) is obtained by isolating \( \mu \) from the inequality.
   - Add and subtract \( 1.96 \frac{\sigma}{\sqrt{n}} \) to/from \( \bar{X} \):

\[
\bar{X} - 1.96 \frac{\sigma}{\sqrt{n}} \leq \mu \leq \bar{X} + 1.96 \frac{\sigma}{\sqrt{n}}
\]

2. **Express the Interval Estimate**:
   - The interval estimate for \( \mu \) can now be written as:

\[
\mu \text{ is estimated to lie between } \bar{X} - 1.96 \frac{\sigma}{\sqrt{n}} \text{ and } \bar{X} + 1.96 \frac{\sigma}{\sqrt{n}}
\]

This interval is the **95% confidence interval** for the population mean \( \mu \), based on the sample mean \( \bar{X} \).
